Query 1:Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve an 
employee whose name is “Rahul”,either as a worker or as a manager 
of the department that controls the project.
SELECT pno 
FROM workson 
WHERE Eid IN
(SELECT Eid FROM employee WHERE name='Rahul') 
UNION 
SELECT Pnum 
FROM project 
WHERE dno IN
(SELECT Dnum FROM department WHERE DMgr_id IN  
(SELECT Eid FROM employee WHERE name='Rahul'));


Query 2:Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the “IoT” project is given a 10 percent
raise.


SELECT Eid,name, salary,salary+0.1*salary as updated_salary 
FROM employee  
WHERE Eid IN
(SELECT Eid FROM workson WHERE pno IN(
SELECT pnum FROM project WHERE Pname='IOT'));


Query3:Find the  sum of the  salaries of all employees  of the  “Accounts” department,  as well as the
maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this department.


SELECT SUM(salary), AVG(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary)
FROM employee e,department d
WHERE d.dnum=e.dno AND dname='Account';


Query 4:Retrieve the name of each employee who works on 
all the projects controlled by department number 5 (use NOT EXISTS operator).


SELECT Eid,name 
FROM employee e 
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
(SELECT pnum FROM project WHERE dno=5) MINUS 
(SELECT pno FROM workson w WHERE w.Eid=e.Eid)
);


QUERY 5:Create a view Dept_info that gives details of department name, 
Number of employees and total salary of each department.


Create view dept_info(name,count_emp,sum_sal) as
Select d.dname, count(*), sum(salary) 
From department d inner join employee e
ON e.Dno = d.Dnum
Group by d.Dname;


SELECT * FROM DEPT_INFO;
